    Computes the squared Euclidean distance between each element of training

    as vectors.

    This implementation uses a naive set of nested loops over the training and
    test data.

    The input data may have any number of dimensions -- for example this
    function should be able to compute nearest neighbor between vectors, in
    which case the inputs will have shape (num_{train, test}, D); it should
    also be able to compute nearest neighbors between images, where the inputs
    will have shape (num_{train, test}, C, H, W). More generally, the inputs
    will have shape (num_{train, test}, D1, D2, ..., Dn); you should flatten
    each element of shape (D1, D2, ..., Dn) into a vector of shape
    (D1 * D2 * ... * Dn) before computing distances.

    The input tensors should not be modified.

    NOTE: Your implementation may not use `torch.norm`, `torch.dist`,
    `torch.cdist`, or their instance method variants (`x.norm`, `x.dist`,
    `x.cdist`, etc.). You may not use any functions from `torch.nn` or
